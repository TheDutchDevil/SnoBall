“Co-citation is defined as the frequency with which two documents are cited together by other documents.[1] If at least one other document cites two documents in common these documents are said to be co-cited. The more co-citations two documents receive, the higher their co-citation strength, and the more likely they are semantically related.” [1]

- Cited by: the article that cited both the source and target node
- Source: article that refers to the target node
- Target: article that is referred to by the source node
